## Inspiration
The inspiration for this game came from the popular online game [Logic Bloxorz](https://www.mathplayground.com/logic_bloxorz.html). This game is a simple yet challenging puzzle game where the goal is to navigate a block to a target tile by rolling it over a series of tiles. Our team was inspired by the simplicity and difficulty of the game and decided to create our own version with new and improved features.
